# Monkeys-Typing
The Monkeys Typing algorithm is a custom variant of the genetic algorithm.

It's a bit rough, as I came up with the idea in my freshman year of college, but it does generally work.
The backend framework for this algorithm was provided by the CS1 spacegame assignment - thanks Dr. Hibbs!
