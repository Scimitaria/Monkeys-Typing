# Monkeys-Typing
The Monkeys Typing algorithm is a custom variant of the genetic algorithm.

It's a bit rough, as I came up with the idea in my freshman year of college, but it does generally work.
The backend framework for this algorithm was provided by the CS1 spacegame assignment - thanks Dr. Hibbs!

This program can be run manually with the standard gradle command:
```
./gradlew run -Pmain=cs2.AIP.<main file>
```

There is also a shell script for ease of use:
```
./run <main file>
```

The main files are:

### Playground:
An R&D ground for the algorithms. 
Very barebones in terms of graphics, but a good way to test different parameters.
This is the default if no name is specified in the script.

### Mario (UNDER DEVELOPMENT):
